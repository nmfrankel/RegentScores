# RegentScores

This is a blackboard web-app I built for my high-school to post and host our regent scores online.

## Benefits

-	The basic benefit of such a system is that parents/students can veiw their (childs') scores as soon as they become available.
-	Additionally, with such a system the facilty get harassed for scores at a significantly lower rate.

## Setup

*	Details and walk thorugh coming soon

## What I Exercised/Learned

-	Create and interact with a **mySQL database**.
-	Developed a **RESTful API** to communicate between the front-end and back-end.
-	**Authenticate users** to have limited-privilages for the system...
```
	Admin -> admin access
	Parent/Student -> student access
```
-	The school can **lockout a user** to block the Parent/Student from seeing their score temporarily.
