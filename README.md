# RegentScores

This is a blackboard web-app I built for my high-school to post and host our regent scores online.

<!-- ## Project backstory

**coming soon** -->

## Benefits

The basic benefit of such a system is that parents/students can veiw their (childs') scores as soon as they become available. Additionally, with such a system the facilty get harassed for scores at a significantly lower rate.

## Setup

**Details and walk thorugh coming soon**

## What I Exercised/Learned

-	Create and interact with a **SQL database**.
-	Developed a **REST API** to communicate between the front and backend.
-	**Authenticate users** to have limited-privilages for the system...
>	Admin -> admin access to insert scores and block users
>	Parent/Student -> student access with the ability to view their scores
-	The admin can **lockout a user** to block the Parent/Student from seeing their score until they contact the school.
